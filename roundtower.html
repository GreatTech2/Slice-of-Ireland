        <h1>Review</h1>
        <p class="FirstT">“The Swords Round Tower has stood since the 6th century and it looks very old. We were disappointed that we couldn't climb the Round Tower, but that is not possible. The view of the town must be amazing. It's still worth the walk to see.”</p>

        <h1>Background </h1>
        <p class="imgtext" style="margin-right: 170px">The Swords Round Tower dates from the 6th century and is considered one of the town's oldest historical landmarks second only to the local holy Well from the 500s AD. The purpose of the Round Tower was to store valuables such as gold or religious relics and keep them out of reach from those that might steal them such as invading Vikings. Along with this, it is one of the tallest non modern buildings in the town as it can be seen from anywhere.</p>

        <h1>Monastery</h1>
        <p class="FirstT">The Tower marks the location of an old and long-gone monastery that was founded by St. Colmcille himself. It was said that this monastery and the well that the rest of the town grew around. As said before the original monastery was destroyed long ago with the tower being the only surviving remnant. They would eventually go on to be one of the most powerful in Ireland and even waked the body of High King Brian Boru as his funeral cortege rested overnight on the way to his burial place in Armagh.</p>

        <h1>Church</h1>
        <p class="FirstT" >While the original monastery has been long since destroyed having been burned on at least ten separate occasions the perpetrators ranging from invading Vikings and later Oliver Cromwell and each time the monks that survived the attacks always rebuilt it. The church that is currently standing is the Saint Columba's Church which was built in 1811. It is also the fourth time that a church has been built at the location.</p>

        <h1>Construction</h1>
        <p class="FirstT">Saint Columba's Church is a Georgian-styled building, which was constructed at the beginning of the year 1811 by Francis Johnston, who also constructed the GPO on O'Connell Street. It was designed in the Gothic revival style which is identified by its intricate detailing, tall, vertical emphasis, large windows, and a plethora of pointed arches.</p>

        <h1 style="color:#25A956 ">Graveyard</h1>
        <p class="imgtext" style=" color: black">Like with many old churches, the grounds also have a graveyard with a number of people however very few of which are of much historical significance, however, they are open to explore with tours being available and provided by the swords heritage society who will provide information on some of the people who inhabit it such as who they where and personal stories about them.</p>

        <h1 style="color:#25A956 ">Belfry</h1>
        <p class="FirstT" style="color: black">The Belfry is from the 14th century from one of the many rebuilt monasteries. Much like the round tower, the square belfry is all that remains of this version of the church but many of the old walls were removed when the new church was being built it has since been converted into a clock tower.</p>

        <p class="FirstT" style="color: black">As stated the Tower and the buildings surrounding it hold great significance to the community as they are a look at the town's history both the old and new from the very beginning of this town's birth as a simple village as well as a symbol that the whole town can see</p>

        <h1 style="color:#25A956 ">Religion</h1>
        <p class="FirstT" style="color: black">Saint Columba's church is an Anglican church which is a Christian religion that developed from many of the practices, liturgy, and identity of the Church of England after the English Reformation. To many, it is seen as the middle ground between Roman Catholicism and Lutheran Protestantism as it uses many of the same or similar traditions of both groups.</p>
