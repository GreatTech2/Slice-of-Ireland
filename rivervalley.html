        <h1>Review</h1>
        <p class="FirstT">“I'm a regular visitor to the park, along with my 6 year old Jack Russell. All year round and sheltered down in the valley itself, good walks and exercise machines along the upper walks. It's very easy to find you have done a 4 or 5 km walk without realizing it !<br>Highly recommend”</p>

In fact for some time the river was an important aspect of the community as it served many different purposes such as how many of the local boy would use if to help learn how to swim.
