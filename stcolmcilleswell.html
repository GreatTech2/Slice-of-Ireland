        <h1>Holy Wells</h1>
        <p class="imgtext">It has been said that there are over 3,000 holy wells located in Ireland however as they are often unmarked on maps and undistinguished by archaeological features, holy wells are a uniquely vulnerable category of ancient sites. They continue to be lost to farming, drainage work, development or neglect.</p>

        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p class="FirstT">Swords own well is known as St. Colmcille's Holy Well is one of the most important sites located in the town. This is due to its connection to the founding of the town. Located on Well Road, it is said to have been blessed by the founder of the town Saint Colmcille in the 500s AD and it is said to have healing properties. It is also where the town got its original name that being Sord which was, in fact, the Irish word for “clear” or “pure”. However, as the century past words and languages would change and be misinterpreted which led to the town's name eventually changing to Sword due to how similar the word sounded to Sord.

        <p class="FirstT" style="color: black">Since the well was first blessed, the town has continued to grow around it with many buildings being demolished and rebuild in order to fit the modern world however the well remained the same as it did hundreds of years ago with only a few updates such as the pump that is directly above it to allow easier access to the water.</p>
