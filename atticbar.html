        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p class="imgtext">What visitiers to the town may not know is that the pub actulay has two different names that are often used interchangably, those names being the Pound and the Attic. This pube has been around for over 200 year and is located directly next to the ruins of Swords Castle. The reaoson for the two names is the owners of the pub the McGranes family converted the upstairs bar and lounge into a second bar hence the name the attic.</p>
