        <p class="FirstT">“I'm a impressed by how long the remains of the Glasmore abby have been able to stay up, when first looking at it I never would have known of its signifacince until looking into it and concidering how long it it has been hear shows the respect the people of the area have for it”</p>

        <h1>Origins</h1>
        <p class="imgtext">Glasmore Abbey was founded in the year 660 AD by St. Cronan Mochua, orignialy from Clashmore located in county Waterford, roughly one hundred years after the founding of the town of Swords which was still small at the time. It was said that Cronan was a disciple of St. Carthage of Lismore and served as a monk and bossably as an abbot in Lismore before he eventualy left and settled in Swords.</p>

        <h1>Growth</h1>
        <p class="FirstT">It is said that while under his guidence the abbey at Swords flourished and prosperd as the the town its self, however this wealth had the negative affect of drawing the attention of fearece Danish pirates and vikings who had landed at Inbher Domhnann, which in the modern day is know as the Malahide harbour. This lead to them ataking the abby and stealing what ever riches that may have held at the time.

        <h1>Distruction</h1>
        <p class="FirstT" style="color: white;">While the year is unknown it is said that on the night of February 10th, those pirates attacked and plundered the abbey as well as killed St. Cronan and all his monks that were livving there and left what remaind of the building to fall apart. Today the ruins of this abbey stand in a green between Cianlea and Lioscian estates and not far from the swords round tower.</p>

        <h1  style="color:#25A956">Debate</h1>
        <p class="FirstT" style="color: black">Many beleve this is not the true abby as it was said the the ruins are quite small for an abby. In fact according to records as well as Annals from around that time, the Abbey was said to positioned somewhere in the South part of Swords and not in the North as this structure was, this has ended up leading to some confusion and doubt as to what it really was but until real proff of what it is is found many are content to beleve that it is the Glasmore Abbey ruins.</p>

        <h1 style="color:#25A956 ">St Cronan’s well</h1>
        <p class="imgtext" style=" color: black">One of the reasons many thought that it was the Glasmore Abbey was due to its proximity to the holy well know as St Cronan’s well, one of the few holey wells in swords simaler to the st. colmcille's well. However it is not as protected it is a small spring in a small covered in grass and bull rushes and is very easy to miss<br>

        <h1 style="color:#25A956 ">Protection</h1>
        <p class="FirstT" style="color: black">The ruins have been inclosed by a  low fence for protection since the year 2000 as they were deemed to be dangerous by a council inspector at the time. The developer of the then new housing estate also agreed to remove the ivy that had been growing on it and reinforce the walls where it was deemed to be most necessary so that development this also made it more visalbe to visiters whiching to see it.</p>
