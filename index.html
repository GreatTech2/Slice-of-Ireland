        <p class="FirstT" style="color: black;">The Town of Swords is located in Fingal County in the Republic of Ireland and possesses a long and interesting history, being founded in the year 560 AD over a thousand years ago, originally under the name Sord, the Irish word for "clear" or "pure", by a well-known saint by the name of Colmcille an Irish abbot and missionary born in 521 AD. Starting off as a simple monastic settlement</p>

        <h1 style="color: #25A956">Swords: Significance</h1>
        <p class="FirstT" style="color: black">Eventually, it began to grow in influence even serving as the location of High King Brian Boru's wake before being buried in Armagh. Since its founding many historic buildings have been erected that have withstood the tests of time and have thus become iconic to the area like the holy well where the town got its name from.</p>
